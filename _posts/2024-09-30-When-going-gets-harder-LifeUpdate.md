Most blog posts only share the good things, but no one updates about their life when nothing seems to be going well. I'm going to do just that.

**ONE THING: I'M YOUNG AND BROKE**

Building a startup is a journey filled with hopelessness and sudden bursts of happiness. One day you'll hear from customers about how great your product is, and other days it'll be completely silent - leaving you feeling worthless and ready to quit.

That's the situation I'm in right now.

I'm in my final year of a CS college degree while also building a startup. 

Sometimes it gets incredibly hard to balance these two commitments. (I was never passionate about university, although I wanted to study in the US to surround myself with great minds.) But money problems hold you down.

Right now, I'm facing ***two choices:***

Two hours ago, I was scrolling LinkedIn and saw a post about companies hiring React Native developers - an area where I have experience. I clicked the link and discovered Google was hiring for early career positions. My first thought was to apply, but then CALM EMAIL came to mind.

I was left with two options: apply to Google or keep working on my startup.

I considered applying for the role, as it would provide the money I desperately need right now. My financial situation isn't even close to being above what you'd call "good." We're struggling to even pay our rent.

I don't know what the future holds for me.

I've always loved San Francisco, and this startup is my only path to get there. I wasn't born during the internet era, but we're now in one of the most exciting times of technological revolution because of AI. I don't want to turn 80 and regret not giving my best during my youth.

As I write this, I do have a decision in mind:

* I'll create a resume (including all the projects I've done so far and adding this startup as experience) and apply.
* If selected, I'll probably work at Google for some time, save enough money to move to SF, and then make the move.

Another thought that crosses my mind is that I want to be someone who can say they never had a job in their entire life - that I always worked on my own projects. But this goes against the decision I've just made.

I once heard a YC founder say this. So I thought, if she can do it, why can't I?

Let's see what we can accomplish.

Along with all this, I'm looking for a co-founder. I know I get rejected from accelerators because I'm solo, and getting into one is the surest way for me to make it to SF.

After all, this is what I want to do now or in the future. So why not now?

I'll do whatever it takes to improve my financial situation and build my startup.

I've always believed that people in this world are inherently good, but sometimes money makes people act inhumanely - like animals fighting over a piece of paper. This sometimes erodes my trust in humanity.

It depresses me to realize this. I want to love humanity, but when the world presents these challenges, how can I maintain that love?
