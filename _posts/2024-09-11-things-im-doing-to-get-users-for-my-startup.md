## Things I'm Doing to Get Users for Calm Email

Hi,

I just read a blog post by Chris Bakke on how to get users for your B2B software company. 

I found it really helpful and wanted to find a place where I could save this, but I decided to post it here instead:

By the way, I'm typing this on my phone (on GitHub.com, lol).

Anyway, here are the hyper-targeted steps I will take to get users for Calm Email:

1. Build a list of 20 founders (who just launched their companies, mainly on YC Launch, VC social media, etc.).
2. Make a plan to creatively reach out to all of them and set a goal of getting at least 4-5 of them to agree to a demo or try Calm Email within the next 30 days.
3. Outreach strategy: try to send a LinkedIn DM without a message, then follow up with a more personalized DM.

This is what I read and will implement.

I am good at building products but not at marketing them.

I probably wasn’t born as a seller (but I’ll have to learn that).

Let’s see how much we are able to get done.

Thanks for reading ✌️
