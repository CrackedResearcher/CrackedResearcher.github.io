##Things im doing to get users for Calm Email

hi

i just read a in a blog post by chris bakke on how to get users for your b2b software company 

i found it really hekpful and wanted to find a place where i could save this but decided do post it here instead:

btw im typing this on my phone (on github.com lol)

anyways heres the hyoer targeted steps i will take to get users for CalmEmail;

1. build a list of 20 founders (who just lauched their companies, mainly on yc lanuch, vc social medias etc)
2. make a plan to creatively reachout to all of them and make a goal of atleast getting 4/5 of them to agree for a demo or try calm email in next 30 days
3. i try x to outreach + send linkedin dm without any mesage then send dm

this is what i read and will implement.

i am good at building products but not marketing things

i probably wasnt born as a seller (but ill have to learn that)

lets see how much we are abke to get done.

thanks for reading 
✌️
