# hi, this is my first post (probably my first blog post)

in this post, iâ€™ll give you an update on my startup, **[calm email](https://calmemail.xyz)**.

---

### here's what i've already done:

1. **completed building** the full system of ai agents that work for you.
2. **successfully deployed** the system.

---

### here's what i wanna do right now:

1. **2 users ready to test** what weâ€™ve built  
   *(we had early users before, but they werenâ€™t from our target niche, so we restarted).*

2. **outreach to more founders** on twitter  
   *(probably cuz theyâ€™re in _chill mode_ over there)*  
   i'll try to get them to test it.

3. **figuring out a good outreach message**  
   *(finding a good way to do outreach)*  
   **i hate doing outreach ðŸ˜©**

4. **considering adding a payment option** on the website  
   to see if users are interested in paying â€“ itâ€™s a **good signal** that someone finds what youâ€™ve built **valuable**.


ps:
i want to be genuine with you guys and admit that the first version of this blog had a lot of grammatical errors. then, i asked gpt to help me create a highly formatted (markdown) + error-free version. and here it is â€“ the post youâ€™re reading right now!
