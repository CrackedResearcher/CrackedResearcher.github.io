# hi, this is my first post (probably my first blog post)

in this post, iâ€™ll give you an update on my startup, **[calm email](https://calmemail.xyz)**.

---

### here's what i've already done:

1. **completed building** the full system of ai agents that work for you.
2. **successfully deployed** the system.

---

### here's what i wanna do right now:

1. **2 users ready to test** what weâ€™ve built  
   *(we had early users before, but they werenâ€™t from our target niche, so we restarted).*

2. **outreach to more founders** on twitter  
   *(probably cuz theyâ€™re in _chill mode_ over there)*  
   i'll try to get them to test it.

3. **figuring out a good outreach message**  
   *(finding a good way to do outreach)*  
   **i hate doing outreach ðŸ˜©**

4. **considering adding a payment option** on the website  
   to see if users are interested in paying â€“ itâ€™s a **good signal** that someone finds what youâ€™ve built **valuable**.

### extras (if you're interested):

- i applied to yc's (ycombinators) first yc fall batch f24 with **calm email**.
- i submitted the demo video and app just **1 hour** before the deadline. 
- i had to record the founder intro video at least **6 times** before getting the perfect shot (perfectionist i am ðŸ¤£).  
   - recording those videos was **awkward** for me; facing myself on camera felt strange.
   
- i thought the yc group partners would review my app on a **laptop**, but my landing page wasnâ€™t ready for desktop! if they had to open the website on their phone, thatâ€™d add unnecessary friction and might get me rejected.  

- so, from **3PM to 6PM**, i sat down with my pair programmer claude and **v0.dev** to build a sleek-looking desktop landing page. 
- added some **accordions** with q&a, so anyone with questions could easily see answers. (this was my first time doing this â€“ iâ€™m proud of it!)
- the inspiration came from the website **ottogrid.ai** â€“ i know its founder on x.com, so i saw it there.

hereâ€™s the current version of the website (itâ€™s not perfect, but i kinda love it):

### ps:
i want to be genuine with you guys and admit that the first version of this blog had a lot of grammatical errors. then, i asked gpt to help me create a highly formatted (markdown) + error-free version. and here it is â€“ the post youâ€™re reading right now!

and if you're a founder reading this, be sure to try **calm email** â€“ iâ€™m sure you'd love using it!
