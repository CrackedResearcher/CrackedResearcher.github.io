First off my name isnt CrackedResearcher - when i created my github account i didnt know i would eventually create a blog here haha

you can call me Ayush ðŸ‘‹ 

i am 20 yrs old.

i love to engineer softwares and  build ai native systems + code a lot of side projects too 

i built this blog to basically share my learnings with you guys.
by learnings i mean whatever i learn during building my startups and going through life 

also just as a way to  practise writing more (inspiration came from paul graham and sam altman)


currently:

- im building an AI startup called CalmEmail (calmemail.xyz) -> its an AI powered email assistant for founders
- (btw if u know someone who would like to  invest do lemme know :)

previously:

- was part of Buildspace (a place where you could work on your ideas) it was a yc company
  
- was building a Trustpilot like platform but for course creators (secur-esnap.web.app) + stopped buikding it to focus all my attention on CalmEmail
  
- started a small video production agency and worked with saas companies, ScaleeVision.com (i dont own this domain tho now)

some of my favourite side projects:

- AI voice debater - give it a topic and get an mp3 of two ais debating on that for you (link: ai-voice-debater.vercel.app)
